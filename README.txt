CIS 422 Project 2
Running the program is straight forward within the directory. requirements.txt shows all command lines that will install necessary components. 
pandas      # pip install pandas
sqlite3     # Should be standard, if not: pip install pysqlite3
flask       # pip install flask
flask-wtf   # pip install flask-wtf
flask-login # pip install flask-login
If all that is done, keep all the files together in one folder and run server.py, which should give the linked
website to test the project.
Compiler version is python 3.8 and system uses conda in pycharm. 

subdirectories included in project are .idea, db, resources/icons, static, templates, and testing. 
.idea contains xml files for website, db contains database information, resources/icons are icons for website, static is website js and css files for website 
functioning. templates contains html files for website and testing includes testing for the database.
